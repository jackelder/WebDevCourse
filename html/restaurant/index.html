        <p>The RR Diner ("The Double R") has been a beloved member of the
          Twin Peaks community since it was established here on Garfield
          Street in 1980. Owned and run since then by Norma, the RR Diner
          serves up coffee, pie, breakfast, lunch and dinner: always fresh,
          filling and tasty American fare.</p>
