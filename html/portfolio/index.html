    <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota with a
      Masters of Science in Chemistry. I have also trained and worked as a
      chemist at the University of Puget Sound and the Infectious Disease
      Research Institute in Seattle, Washington.</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a transition into a career in
      software development.</p>

    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
    <p>While at the University of Puget Sound, I performed two summers
      of undergraduate research and a senior thesis in organic synthesis.
      I also worked as a Peer Advisor to assist first-year students in their
      transition to college. I have been tutoring general and organic
      chemisty for over three years and also enjoy various volunteering.</p>
    <p>My coding experience has included one semester of Computer Science
      in Java at the University of Puget Sound, as well as online coursework
      in Python and SQL.</p>
